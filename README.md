## Install using a script

### poppler-utils

In a special case where your distribution doesn't include the **poppler-utils** package in its repositories, use the `--all` parameter of the installation script to include **poppler-utils** in the installation:

    ./install.py --all

- <p>The <b>poppler-utils</b> package included in the installation script is designed for the <b>amd64</b> architecture. If you need this package for a different architecture, we recommend checking the official <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/" >poppler-utils</a> page and obtaining the source code.</p>
- If you need to uninstall everything, run `./install.py` again with the `--remove-all` parameter.
