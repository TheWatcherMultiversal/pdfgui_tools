# Code

Here is where the code and program logic are stored. Modify the files only if you know what you're doing; the code is documented to enhance readability. If you intend to modify something, I recommend reading this first: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/

### Files:

- `pdfgui_tools.py` - main section of the app
- `pdfgui_pdfunite.py` - merge PDFs
- `pdfgui_pdftohtml.py` - PDF to html
- `pdfgui_pdftotext.py` - PDF to text
- `about.py` - about window
