# Command

Here is the main file of `pdfgui_tools`; the UI files are located in the "**designers**" directory. If you want to make more precise modifications to the interface, please refer to that directory. In this file, you can modify the functions of the application and how they are connected to the functionalities included in `pdfguiUtils.py`, a file that contains the utilities of **pdfgui_tools**. 

If you intend to modify something, I recommend reading this first: https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/
